                <li><strong>Who can participate in a clinical trial?</strong> Participation depends on meeting eligibility criteria like age, gender, medical history, and health status.</li>
                <li><strong>What is informed consent?</strong> A process where participants learn about the trial's purpose, risks, benefits, and procedures to make an informed decision.</li>
                <li><strong>Will I be paid for participating in a clinical trial?</strong> Compensation varies by study and may include reimbursement for time, travel, or expenses.</li>
                <li><strong>Can I leave a clinical trial after enrolling?</strong> Yes, participation is voluntary, and you can withdraw anytime without penalty.</li>
                <li><strong>What happens if I experience side effects during the trial?</strong> Report them immediately to the research team for guidance and support.</li>
                <li><strong>How are participants assigned to groups?</strong> Often, participants are assigned randomly to different groups to reduce bias.</li>
                <li><strong>Will I know which treatment I am receiving?</strong> Some studies are blinded, so participants and researchers may not know who receives which treatment to prevent bias.</li>
                <li><strong>How long do clinical trials last?</strong> Duration varies, ranging from weeks to years depending on the trial phase and objectives.</li>
                <li><strong>What happens after the trial ends?</strong> Data is analyzed, and participants may be informed of findings. Continued access to the treatment may be offered in some cases.</li>
                <li><strong>Are clinical trials covered by insurance?</strong> Insurance coverage varies. Some costs may be covered by the sponsor, while others may be billed to your insurance or out-of-pocket.</li>
                <li><strong>What is a placebo, and will I receive one?</strong> A placebo is an inactive substance. Not all trials use placebos; this is explained during informed consent.</li>
