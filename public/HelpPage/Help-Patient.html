        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>What is a clinical trial?</strong> A research study to evaluate medical, surgical, or behavioral
            interventions, determining their safety and effectiveness.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Who can participate in a clinical trial?</strong> Participation depends on meeting eligibility
            criteria like age, gender, medical history, and health status.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>What is informed consent?</strong> A process where participants learn about the trial's purpose,
            risks, benefits, and procedures to make an informed decision.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Will I be paid for participating in a clinical trial?</strong> Compensation varies by study and may
            include reimbursement for time, travel, or expenses.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Can I leave a clinical trial after enrolling?</strong> Yes, participation is voluntary, and you can
            withdraw anytime without penalty.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>What happens if I experience side effects during the trial?</strong> Report them immediately to the
            research team for guidance and support.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>How are participants assigned to groups?</strong> Often, participants are assigned randomly to
            different groups to reduce bias.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Will I know which treatment I am receiving?</strong> Some studies are blinded, so participants and
            researchers may not know who receives which treatment to prevent bias.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>How long do clinical trials last?</strong> Duration varies, ranging from weeks to years depending on
            the trial phase and objectives.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>What happens after the trial ends?</strong> Data is analyzed, and participants may be informed of
            findings. Continued access to the treatment may be offered in some cases.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Are clinical trials covered by insurance?</strong> Insurance coverage varies. Some costs may be
            covered by the sponsor, while others may be billed to your insurance or out-of-pocket.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>What is a placebo, and will I receive one?</strong> A placebo is an inactive substance. Not all
            trials use placebos; this is explained during informed consent.
          </li>
